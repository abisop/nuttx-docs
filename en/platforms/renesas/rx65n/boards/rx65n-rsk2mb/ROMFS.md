  Overview
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This directory contains logic to support a custom ROMFS system-init script
  and start-up script. These scripts are used by by the NSH when it starts
  provided that CONFIG\_ETC\_ROMFS=y. These scripts provide a ROMFS volume
  that will be mounted at /etc and will look like this at run-time:

    NuttShell (NSH) NuttX-8.2
    nsh> ls -l /etc
    /etc:
     dr-xr-xr-x       0 .
     -r--r--r--      20 group
     dr-xr-xr-x       0 init.d/
     -r--r--r--      35 passwd
    /etc/init.d:
     dr-xr-xr-x       0 ..
     -r--r--r--     110 rcS
     -r--r--r--     110 rc.sysinit
    nsh>

/etc/init.d/rc.sysinit is system init script; /etc/init.d/rcS is the
start-up script; /etc/passwd is a the password file. It supports a
single user:

    USERNAME:  admin
    PASSWORD:  Administrator

    nsh> cat /etc/passwd
    admin:8Tv+Hbmr3pLVb5HHZgd26D:0:0:/

The encrypted passwords in the provided passwd file are only valid if
the TEA key is set to: 012345678 9abcdef0 012345678 9abcdef0. Changes to
either the key or the password word will require regeneration of the
nsh\_romfimg.h header file.

The format of the password file is:

    user:x:uid:gid:home

Where: user: User name x: Encrypted password uid: User ID (0 for now)
gid: Group ID (0 for now) home: Login directory (/ for now)

/etc/group is a group file. It is not currently used.

    nsh> cat /etc/group
    root:*:0:root,admin

The format of the group file is:

    group:x:gid:users

Where: group: The group name x: Group password gid: Group ID users: A
comma separated list of members of the group

  Updating the ROMFS File System
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The content on the nsh\_romfsimg.h header file is generated from a sample
  directory structure. That directory structure is contained in the etc/ directory and can be modified per the following steps:

    1. Change directory to etc/:

       cd etc/

    2. Make modifications as desired.

    3. Create the new ROMFS image.

       genromfs -f romfs_img -d etc -V SimEtcVol

    4. Convert the ROMFS image to a C header file

        xxd -i romfs_img >nsh_romfsimg.h

    5. Edit nsh_romfsimg.h, mark both data definitions as 'const' so that
       that will be stored in FLASH.
