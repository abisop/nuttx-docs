CONFIG\_SCHED\_WORKQUEUE=y : Work queue support is needed
CONFIG\_SCHED\_HPWORK=y : High Priority Work queue support
CONFIG\_SCHED\_LPWORK=y : Low Priority Work queue support

Using the network with NSH
--------------------------

The IP address is configured using DHCP, using the below mentioned
configurations :

The IP address is configured using DHCP, using the below mentioned
configurations :

CONFIG\_NETUTILS\_DHCPC=y CONFIG\_NETUTILS\_DHCPD=y CONFIG\_NSH\_DHCPC=y
CONFIG\_NETINIT\_DHCPC=y

nsh\> ifconfig eth0 HWaddr 00:e0:de:ad:be:ef at UP IPaddr:10.75.24.53
DRaddr:10.75.24.1 Mask:255.255.254.0

You can use ping to test for connectivity to the host (Careful, Window
firewalls usually block ping-related ICMP traffic). On the target side,
you can:

nsh\> ping 10.75.24.250 PING 10.75.24.250 56 bytes of data 56 bytes from
10.75.24.250: icmp\_seq=1 time=0 ms 56 bytes from 10.75.24.250:
icmp\_seq=2 time=0 ms 56 bytes from 10.75.24.250: icmp\_seq=3 time=0 ms
56 bytes from 10.75.24.250: icmp\_seq=4 time=0 ms 56 bytes from
10.75.24.250: icmp\_seq=5 time=0 ms 56 bytes from 10.75.24.250:
icmp\_seq=6 time=0 ms 56 bytes from 10.75.24.250: icmp\_seq=7 time=0 ms
56 bytes from 10.75.24.250: icmp\_seq=8 time=0 ms 56 bytes from
10.75.24.250: icmp\_seq=9 time=0 ms 56 bytes from 10.75.24.250:
icmp\_seq=10 time=0 ms 10 packets transmitted, 10 received, 0% packet
loss, time 10100 ms

On the host side, you should also be able to ping the RX65N-GRROSE:

\$ ping 10.75.24.53

Configure UDP blaster application as mentioned below :

CONFIG\_EXAMPLES\_UDPBLASTER\_HOSTIP=0x0a4b1801 (10.75.24.1) ------\>

(255.255.254.0) --------\> Netmask
CONFIG\_EXAMPLES\_UDPBLASTER\_TARGETIP=0x0a4b189b (10.75.24.155)
---------\> Target IP

Debugging
=========

1.  NuttX needs to be compiled in Cygwin.

The following Configuration needs to be set, in order to do source level
debugging.

CONFIG\_DEBUG\_SYMBOLS = y (Set this option, using menuconfig only, DO
NOT Enable this as default configuration).

2.  Download & Install Renesas e2studio IDE.
3.  Load the project(NuttX built on Cygwin) as Makefile project with
    existing code
4.  Right click on the project, and select Debug Configurations.
5.  The binary(NuttX) needs to be loaded using E1/E2 Emulator.
6.  Select the Device name as R5F565NE and Emulator as E1/E2(whichever
    is being used)
7.  Select Connection type as FINE.
8.  Load and run the binary.

Flashing NuttX
==============

Alternatively, NuttX binary can be flashed using Renesas flash
programmer tool without using e2 studio/Cygwin

Below are the steps mentioned to flash NuttX binary using Renesas flash
programmer tool(RFP).

1.In order to flash using Renesas flash programmer tool, nuttx.mot file
should be generated. 2. Add the following lines in tools/Unix.mk file :
ifeq (\$(CONFIG\_MOTOROLA\_SREC),y) @echo "CP: nuttx.mot" \$(Q)
\$(OBJCOPY) \$(OBJCOPYARGS) \$(BIN) -O srec -I elf32-rx-be-ns nuttx.mot
endif 3. Add CONFIG\_MOTOROLA\_SREC=y in defconfig file or choose make
menucofig-\>Build Setup-\> Binary Output Format-\> Select Motorola SREC
format. 4. Download Renesas flash programmer tool from
https://www.renesas.com/in/en/products/software-tools/tools/programmer/renesas-flash-programmer-programming-gui.html\#downloads
5. Refer to the user manual document, for steps to flash NuttX binary
using RFP tool.
