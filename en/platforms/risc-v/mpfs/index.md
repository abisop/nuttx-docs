# Microchip PolarFireÂ® SoC FPGA's (MPFS)

RV64 64-bit RISC-V multiprocessor-based Microcontroller Subsystem
(MPFS025T, MPFS095T, MPFS160T, MPFS250T, MPFS460T)

## MPFS Toolchain

A generic RISC-V toolchain can be used to build MPFS projects. Like:
<https://xpack.github.io/riscv-none-embed-gcc> or
<https://github.com/sifive/freedom-tools/releases>

## Booting

The NuttX works as a standalone operating system that may initialize all
the required clocks and peripherals including DDR memory. Alternatively,
the vendor's HSS bootloader may be used instead to perform all the
initialization steps.

## Building and flashing

Configure the NuttX project: `./tools/configure.sh icicle:nsh` Run
`make` to build the project.

If NuttX is built as a standalone OS with the config option
CONFIG\_MPFS\_BOOTLOADER set, it's important to note that the image size
is very limited: only (128K - 256) bytes. 256 bytes are reserved for the
header that must be prepended into the NuttX binary. This binary is
called hss-envm-wrapper-bm1-dummySbic.bin and may be found from the
vendor's HSS implementation. Moreover, after prepending the 256-byte
header, the LMA section needs to be adjusted, for example:

    riscv64-unknown-elf-objcopy -I binary -O ihex --change-section-lma *+0x20220000 nuttx.bin nuttx.hex

The output binary nuttx.hex may be flashed with the LiberoSoc tool. The
tool is available from:
<https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/fpga-and-soc-design-tools/fpga/libero-software-later-versions#Documents%20and%20Downloads>

There's an alternative way to use NuttX, without the
CONFIG\_MPFS\_BOOTLOADER option set. This expects the HSS bootloader
sets up the system (memories, caches, initializes clocks etc.). First
make sure that `hss-payload-generator` is installed. Available from:
<https://github.com/polarfire-soc/hart-software-services>

This tool is used to convert the ELF/bin to a compatible HSS payload
image

Create HSS payload bin:

    hss-payload-generator -v -c hss-nuttx.yml payload.bin

## Debugging with OpenOCD

Compatible OpenOCD and configs can be downloaded from:
<https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/design-tools/4879-softconsole#downloads>

OpenOCD can then be used:

    openocd -c "set DEVICE MPFS" --file board/microsemi-riscv.cfg

## Peripheral Support
