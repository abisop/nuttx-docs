Sensor Drivers
==============

Currently in NuttX we have 3 different approaches to sensor interfaces:

> sensors/sensors\_uorb.rst sensors/sensors\_legacy.rst
> sensors/sensors\_cluster.rst

The preferred way for implementing new sensors is the
`New sensor framework <new_sensor_framework>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"}, which provides the most general interface.
