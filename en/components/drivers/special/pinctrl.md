Pinctrl Device Drivers
======================

-   The Pinctl driver framework allows applications and drivers to
    flexibly configure and manage pin parameters such as functionality,
    strength, driver type, and slewrate (voltage transition speed). This
    framework significantly enhances the flexibility and configurability
    of the system in terms of hardware interface control.
-   `include/nuttx/pinctrl/pinctrl.h` All structures and APIs needed to
    work with pinctrl drivers are provided in this header file.
-   `struct pinctrl_dev_s` and `struct pinctrl_ops_s`. Each pinctrl
    device driver must implement an instance of `struct pinctrl_dev_s`.
    And the `struct pinctrl_ops_s` defines a call table with the
    following methods:
    1.  **set\_function**: Configures the pin\'s multiplexing (Mux)
        function, allowing it to be set as a specific hardware interface
        (e.g., UART, SPI, I2C) or as a general-purpose GPIO pin.
    2.  **set\_strength**: Allows the user to configure the pin\'s drive
        strength to meet the requirements of different hardware
        interfaces.
    3.  **set\_driver**: Controls the pin\'s driver type, such as
        push-pull output or open-drain output.
    4.  **set\_slewrate**: Enables the configuration of pin slew rate,
        which is crucial for high-speed digital signal transmission,
        optimizing signal rise and fall times.
    5.  **select\_gpio**: Configures the pin function as GPIO.
-   Convenience macros are provided to map these operations directly:
    `PINCTRL_SETFUNCTION`,`PINCTRL_SETSTRENGTH`,`PINCTRL_SETDRIVER`,`PINCTRL_SETSLEWRATE`,
    `PINCTRL_SELECTGPIO`.
-   Application developers can configure and control pins by opening
    /dev/pinctrl0 nodes and using the ioctl system call. cmd:
    PINCTRLC\_SETFUNCTION, PINCTRLC\_SETSTRENGTH, PINCTRLC\_SETDRIVER,
    PINCTRLC\_SETSLEWRATE, PINCTRLC\_SELECTGPIO. parameters: struct
    pinctrl\_param\_s.
