NX Graphics Library (`NXGL`)
============================

NXGL provides many APIs, some available for use internally by NX and
others for use by applications as well. Only those APIs intended for
application usage are documented here See `include/nuttx/nx/nxglib.h`
for the full set of APIs; those APIs might be of interest if you are
rendering directly into framebuffer or LCD memory.
