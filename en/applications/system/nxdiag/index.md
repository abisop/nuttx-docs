# `nxdiag` NuttX Diagnostic Tool

The NuttX Diagnostic Tool (Nxdiag) is a command line tool that can be
used to gather information about the NuttX and host systems. It also can
be used to run a tests to verify that the vendor's tools are properly
installed and configured.

Its primary purpose is to gather information that can be used to debug
problems and ease the process of reporting bugs for uninexperienced
users.

This tool uses a Python script (`nuttx/tools/host_info_dump.py`) to
gather information about the host system during build and a C program to
gather information about the NuttX system and display all available
information. For more information about the python script, check the
command line options and code comments of `host_info_dump.py`.

Alternatively, `host_info` target can be used without enabling nxdiag
application and reflashing to get information about system. Target can
work after configuration step and prints information about the NuttX and
host systems.

Nxdiag requires Python 3.6 or later. On Linux distributions, the
`distro` Python module is recommended as it provides more accurate
information about the host system.
